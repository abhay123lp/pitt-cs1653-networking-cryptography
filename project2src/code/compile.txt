--SECTION 0: Installing Java--
In order to compile all associated java files, you will need to download and install the latest 
version of the Java JDK:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
At the time of this writing, the latest version is Java 7u13.

After installing Java, Windows users will need to set their environment variables such that the 
executable "javac" can be recognized by the Command Prompt.
Follow the instructions underneath if you need to set the variables.  If not, this section can be 
skipped.

--SECTION 0.1: Setting Environment Variables on Windows machines--
Start --> Right-click 
My Computer --> Properties
For Windows 7 users, click Advanced System Settings.
Click the Advanced tab.
Click the Environment Variables button.
Under the "System variables" box (NOT "User variables for ..."), find the "Path" variable.
If it does NOT exist, click the New button and name it "Path".
If it does exist, click on it, and click the Edit button.
Under "Variable value", DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS THERE, move 
to the end of the line, type a semicolon, and then type the full path to your JDK bin.  (For 
example, I would type without quotation marks: ";C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_33\bin".)
Click OK, OK, and OK.
(These instructions came from a homework assignment from another class on how to install Java on a 
Windows machine)

--SECTION 1: Pre-compilation instructions--
After retrieving the <ZIPFILENAME>.tgz file, extract the tgz.

--SECTION 2: Compiling--
Open up Command Prompt for Windows, and Terminal for Mac OSX or Linux, and change directory to the 
folder that holds the unzipped files.
Change directory into the "src" folder, entering the following: (slashes may depend on OS)
	javac server/certificateAuthority/CertificateAuthority.java
	javac server/group/RunGroupServer.java
	javac server/file/FileServer.java
	javac client/UserCommands.java

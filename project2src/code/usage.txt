FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:
1) Run CertificateAuthority (CA): java CertificateAuthority

The port for the CA is 4999.

The Cerficate Authority's public key is hard-coded the other members so nobody can impersonate the
CA. The CA keeps track of public keys for other members. The CA uses public-private-key encryption
(RSA) to set up a private channel with a client at which point symmetric keys are exchanged.

2) Start Group Server: java RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since  there must be an 
 administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console to enter a username and password. 
 This name  becomes the first user and is a member of the ADMIN group.  Also, no groups exist.  The 
 group server will by default run on port 8765, but a custom port can be passed as the first command 
 line argument.
 
 The first admin creates other users. The admin enters a password for users. We do not support 
 changing the password.

3) Start File Server: java RunFileServer [(optional) port number]
 The file server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one 
 does not exist. The file server is now online.  The file server will by default
 run on port 4321, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line
 argument.
 
4) Start UserCommands: java UserCommands (default of "localhost" for IP and 8765 for the port,
"ALPHA" for name of Certificate Authority)

Optionally, you can either specify an IP address and port number or just an IP address for the group
server. If you only specify an IP address, then the default port of 8765 will be assigned for the
Group Server. The same applyies for the Certifcate Authority.
	a) java UserCommands IP_ADDRESS IP_NUMBER CA_NAME (CA_NAME can be changed but should be "ALPHA")
	b) java UserCommands IP_ADDRESS (default of 8765 for the port, default of "ALPHA" for CA name)
It will ask for a username, which you should supply, and then you can run the commands.
Type "help" to see a list of commands, and type "man [command]" to see a description and its usage.
Or you can manually take a look at the text file with the corresponding command name to examine its 
description and usage, found in "src/help files".

UserCommands is essentially a terminal. Users log in here with a username and password to the Group
Server. Users can then log into a File Server if desired.

5) Resetting the Servers

	a) To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
	directory. 
 
	b) To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin.
	
	c) To reset the Certificate Authority, delete CATemp.tmp.
